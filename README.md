# Rice-Crop-Disease-Detection-using-Image-Processing
Images of leaves of infected Rice Crop are used to extract the colour, shape, and texture features of infected area. These features are used to train the neural network model, which can classify the different diseases. The dataset used in this project includes 3 diseases: Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf Smut.
